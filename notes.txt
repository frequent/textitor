- only show filename not path in input, strip path by <base> tag?
- switch to RSVP.all(... to handle bulk methods
- bulkRemove really necessary?
- allow to keyboard select multiple files
- fix serviceworker throw on existing file with same name
- select all, save all, delete all, use same keys as in single file menu
- implement folders
- create new cache, consider cache and/or folders
- new cache accessible through arrow left + left
- show only files in cache, not cache itself?


=> maintain self
- create own cache, add all files there to allow editing texitor itself

=> test

=> make it work on softinst? 

=> speak?

=> gitstorage
  - replicate with indexeddb and remote gitstorage
  - createJIO = gitinit => create new repo, this method is to update git config
  - calling createJIO will only update existing git folder if there is one
  - parameters:
    * fork - url => else create empty git
    * upstream - where to send stuff, else local, must be reinitialized
    * user
    * pass
  - documents are branches, attachments are files?
  - post-document = create new branch
  - remove-document = delete branch
  - get-document = checkout branch
  - put?
  - putAttachment = commit file
  - getAttachment = ?
  - removeAttachment = ?
  - repair = push all branches? one branch?

=> cachestorage
  - this is my filesystem to work on, create, edit, delete, ....
  - must work offline
  - commit will do a diff with local gitstorage, allow to init?
  - can add everything to gitstorage. push will send to master

=> github API

var github = new Github({
  username: "frequent",
  password: "",
  auth: "basic"
});
serverless = github.getRepo("frequent", "nexedi-serverless-test")
serverless.getTree("master", function (err, tree) {if (err) {console.log("error");console.log(err);} else {console.log(tree);}});

  - branches? files?
  - jio per branch? document = branch?
  - if document per branch, files are attachments, editing and saving updates attachments
  - of a diff is a new attachment?
