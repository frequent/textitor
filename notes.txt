- correctly show files on memory in file menu using *
- correctly clear form when closing a file
- correctly clear form when saving a file
- fix mimetype broken
- setmodified CSS - disk symbol
- warn of modified content before closing
- fix shortcuts without open menu (close, save)
- fix setmodified to only save when something changed
- save and close all
- delete open file
- delete selected file
- save new cache
- new cache accessible through arrow left + left
- open multiple files, use memory storage, make active handle not only one file
- show only files in cache, not cache itself?
- opening more than one file will setup memory storage, this keeps unsaved files and retrieves them when switching
- add listener for editor tab close
- open multiple files via tabs?

=> gitstorage
  - replicate with indexeddb and remote gitstorage

=> cachestorage
  - serviceworker
  - this is my filesystem to work on, create, edit, delete, ....
  - must work offline
  - commit will do a diff with local gitstorage, allow to init?
  - can add everything to gitstorage. push will send to master

=> github API

var github = new Github({
  username: "frequent",
  password: "",
  auth: "basic"
});
serverless = github.getRepo("frequent", "nexedi-serverless-test")
serverless.getTree("master", function (err, tree) {if (err) {console.log("error");console.log(err);} else {console.log(tree);}});

  - branches? files?
  - jio per branch? document = branch?
  - if document per branch, files are attachments, editing and saving updates attachments
  - of a diff is a new attachment?
