todo: 
OK - renderjsify tristan editor
- add listener for editor tab close


=> gitstorage
  - replicate with indexeddb and remote gitstorage

=> cachestorage
  - serviceworker
  - this is my filesystem to work on, create, edit, delete, ....
  - must work offline, cribjs
  - commit will do a diff with local gitstorage, allow to init?
  - can add everything to gitstorage. push will send to master




So Cedric does what?
- calls jio-configurator which fetches the form
- calls jio-cribjs, which declares load and save (all)
  - > load creates jio
  - uses jio w/ config to allAttachments
  - fetches all attachments using keys
  - puts them with sw gadget
  - returns list of url
  - > save creates jio
  - calls allDocs on sw gadget
  - creates a new entry (counter?) WHY
  - makes ajax calls to fetch IF file not found?
  - pushes all attachments to remote storage
  
> so load fetches everything from remote using jio and dumps it into cache
> and save fetches everything from cache and dumps it on remote

load = dav.allAttachments => sw.put -> returns url-list (custom)
save = sw.allDocs => 




a title bar to click, OPEN, CLOSE, SOURCE, FILES, SAVE, SYNC

SOURCE should allow to define a

text editor, should also work offline but be on git,

text editor, cribjs, jio github storage

jio git = I need branches? files?
one jio per branch or one document per branch

jio > document per branch    master - files are attachements. editing and saving means updating an attachement. Is this a commit, too? No, this should always be local.

how to navigate files?
  
how to open multiple files? > tabs?
  
step 1:
--><script type="text/javascript" src="github.js"></script>
