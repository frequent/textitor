var github = new Github({
  username: "frequent",
  password: "",
  auth: "basic"
});
serverless = github.getRepo("frequent", "nexedi-serverless-test")
serverless.getTree("master", function (err, tree) {if (err) {console.log("error");console.log(err);} else {console.log(tree);}});

  - branches? files?
  - jio per branch? document = branch?
  - if document per branch, files are attachments, editing and saving updates attachments
  - of a diff is a new attachment?
